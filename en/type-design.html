        <h2>Fragment Display – Text – Var</h2>
        <p>One type face, endless possibilities. Optimal readability for (almost) any purpose - with just one font file.</p>
        <p>Sans serif antiqua á la Helvetica seem to be omnipresent. Fragment is different: Especially with the variable font style, Fragment is an attempt to combine readability, style and performance in one font file.</p>

        <h2>Nova Normal – Text – Micro – Var</h2>
        <p>A modern neo-grotesk for the new 20s</p>
        <p>Many companies want something new and independent. Something that clearly sets them apart from their competitors. Often, however, they always want the same thing: their own version of a Neo-Grotesk in the style of a Helvetica®, Akzidenz Grotesk® or Univers®.</p>
        <p>Instead of adapting these familiar typefaces, Nova aims to be a fresh take on the classics. Designed from the ground up, Nova is the essence of these works. Anything you deem dispensable about the genre of the world's most popular typeface has been left out. Everything they love about her is in there. New ideas and conceptual solutions for a modern static grotesque were added to this concentrate. This is how the missing element of a strained font category was created: a typeface whose clear basic character looks familiar and inspires trust, but at the same time is new and individual and therefore made for strong branding. A typeface that emerged from the practice of complex branding projects for the practice of such branding projects.</p>
